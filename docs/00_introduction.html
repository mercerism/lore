    <h1>An Introduction to Lore</h1>

    <p><b>Lore</b> is a new MarkDown-like markup syntax and
    toolchain. The authors were dissatisfied with other solutions and
    decided to make another one. These files are intended to teach you
    about Lore by example and to explain its design rationale. If you
    are viewing these files as HTML or PDF documents, you may want to
    view the "Lore source" that was used to produce them. The examples
    in the text are small and focus on demonstrating a single aspect
    of the <b>Lore Syntax</b>, but the source for this document will
    show you how a complete document was constructed using <b>Lore</b>. You
    can find it at <a href="https://github.com/mercerism/lore/blob/master/docs/00_introduction.lore">https://github.com/mercerism/lore/blob/master/docs/00_introduction.lore</a> .</p>

    <a name="_0_The_Very_Basics"/>
    <h2>1. The Very Basics</h2>

    <p><b>Lore</b> is a markup syntax, a toolchain and a set of assumptions
    about documents.  The syntax is probably the easiest part of Lore to
    understand, so let's talk about that first.  The <b>Lore Toolchain</b>
    includes command-line utilities that convert files formatted using the
    <b>Lore Syntax</b> into HTML, PDF or DocBook/XML files.  As an example, you
    would use the <code>lore2html</code> utility to convert the following
    fragment into HTML:</p>

    <pre>This is a simple example of a //Lore file//. It contains a few
sentences in a few paragraphs.  We hope you find the markup is
__intuitive__ and does not distract from typing content.
  
Paragraphs are just collections of characters, separated by two
"end of lines" -- that's a single Line-Feed on Unix-like systems
or a Carriage-Return / Line-Feed sequence on DOS / Windows-like
systems.
  
Virtually all markup in !!Lore!! is accomplished with digraphs :
two character sequences. This is so you can type regular
sentences without worrying if you're going to accidentally
trigger the formatter.</pre>

    <code><b>01_simple_example.lore</b></code>
  
    <p>To convert this to HTML, you would use the following command (assuming
    the name of this file is <code>01_simple_example.lore</code>.)</p>

    <pre>lore2html 01_simple_example.lore > 01_simple_example.html</pre>

    <p>And you should get the following HTML out:</p>

    <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a simple example of a &lt;i&gt;Lore file&lt;/i&gt;.  It
    contains a few sentences in a few paragraphs.  We hope you
    find the markup is &lt;u&gt;intuitive&lt;/u&gt; and does not distract
    from typing content.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Paragraphs are just collections of characters, separated
    by two "end of lines" &amp;#8211; that's a single Line-Feed on
    Unix-like systems or a Carriage-Return / Line-Feed sequence
    on DOS / Windows-like systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Virtually all markup in &lt;b&gt;Lore&lt;/b&gt; is accomplished with
    digraphs : two character sequences. This is so you can type
    regular sentences without worrying if you're going to
    accidentally trigger the formatter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
    
    <code><b>01_simple_example.html</b></code>

    <p>The actual output of the <code>lore2html</code> command may be slightly
    different.  In this example we indented the HTML elements and made the
    columns narrow to make it a little more readable.  But that's a simple
    example of using Lore from the command line.</p>

    <h3>Design Rationale</h3>

    <p>First, <b>why do we need a new markup language?</b> Why not use <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> or <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)">Textile</a>?
    Or any of the many, many other <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">
    lightweight markup languages</a>?</p>

    <p>We were working on a project and tried both MarkDown and Textile, but
    both "got in our way" for a particular task we were trying to accomplish.
    We were building tools to experiment with <a
    href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/index.html">Literate
    Programming</a> and discovered we too frequently triggered the MarkDown and
    Textile formatters.  After a brief attempt to add literate programming and
    templating support to MarkDown and Textile, we quickly determined it would
    be easier to start from scratch.  The <b>Lore</b> syntax was designed to
    explicitly support annotating blocks of text with arbitrary metadata and
    templating using <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a> and <a
    href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>.  We then realized creating
    a new syntax and a new toolchain would give us the opportunity to develop
    new tools using the very literate programming techniques we wished to
    investigate.</p>

    <p>Okay, <b>Is Lore a Research Project?</b> Well, yes and no. We want to add
    features to tools to support new experiments, but several of us use Lore on
    a daily basis for routine tasks. It's very likely the toolchain will add
    experimental features that are triggered via metadata annotations. But the
    fundamental syntax is stable and support for basic, non-experimental
    features will not change. We are also fans of reverse compatibility; changes
    in the Lore syntax that break existing, non-experimental functionality won't
    be added to Lore.</p>

    <p>Next, <b>why use digraphs for markup?</b> Mostly because people usually
    do not use them when typing English sentences.  We did not want to have to
    worry about accidentally triggering the formatter.</p>

    <p><b>Why did you pick the specfic digraphs you did?</b> The in-line
    formatting digraphs for bold, underline, italic and monospaced all have
    meaning.  The bold digraph is two exclamation points (!!); we figured bolded
    text indicated something "exciting."  What punctuation mark is more exciting
    that the exclamation point?  The italic digraph is two slashes (//); the
    slanted nature of the slashes are supposed to remind the user of the
    slanted, oblique nature of italic print.  The underscore digraph is two
    underbars (__) which hopefully remind the user of the underline that will
    go under the text.  And the double asterisk digraph (**) for inline
    monospaced type is to remind C-programmers of a pointer.  We use in-line
    monospace fonts for small code examples; it was obvious to us.</p>

    <p>The Lore syntax was intended to be easy for humans to consume.  When
    there was a difference between "easy for writers" or "easy for programmers,"
    we opted for "easy for writers."  But we believe the syntax is not
    <i>too</i> difficult for programmers to reason about.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>

    <ol>
      
      <li><b>Lore</b> is a lightweight markup language for annotating simple
      text documents with arbitrary metadata and formatting markup.</li>
      
      <li>It was invented to support experiments in literate programming, but is
      useful in the same contexts that other lightweight markup languages
      are.</li>

      <li>The <i>Lore Toolchain</i> converts plain text files formatted using
      the <i>Lore Syntax</i> into HTML, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL_Formatting_Objects">XSL Formatting
      Objects</a> or <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook">DocBook/XML</a> files. Other
      tools like <a href="https://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a>, <a
      href="https://weasyprint.org/">WeasyPrint</a> or <a
      href="https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</a> can convert HTML
      or FO files into PDFs.</li>

      <li>A Lore file is an ordered collection of <i>blocks</i>.  Blocks are
      separated by two End-of-Line sequences (LF or CRLF.)</li>
        
      <li>Text decoration markup (bold, underline, monospace and italic) is
      triggered by enclosing text in digraphs: (!!) for bold, (//) for italic /
      oblique, (__) for underline and (**) for monospace.</li>

    <h2>2. Annotations, Metadata and Structural Directives</h2>

    <p>If you remember from the previous section, the <b>Lore</b> syntax was
    designed to make it simple to attach metadata to arbitrary blocks of
    text. Metadata can apply to the whole document, a single block or a small
    span of text. Common bits of document metadata include: a document's author,
    it's title, a canonical URL where it can be found on the web or a unique
    document ID.</p>

    <p>Here's an example of a Lore document with metadata attached:</p>

    <pre>::title
An Example Document with Metadata

::abstract
This document provides a simple example of a Lore document with
metadata.</pre>

    <code><b>02_document_with_metadata.lore</b></code>

    <p>There's no standard interpretation of most metadata; it depends on what
    the application processing the Lore file thinks it should do. By default,
    the <code>lore2html</code> utility will convert the document metadata blocks
    into paragraphs, styled with classes unique to the metadata tag.</p>

    <p>The key take-aways here are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>metadata is signified using the "annotation" double-colon digraph (::)</li>
      <li>metadata "tags" preceed the blocks they annotate</li>
    </ol>

    <p>From a syntax point of view, document metadata is just one use of the
    annotation digraph (::). We also use "annotations" to highlight document
    structure and add plain links to documents. Annotations really are the
    "everything else" workhorse of Lore.</p>

    <p>Titles and Section headers automagically generate anchors (targets for
    links) when used with <code>lore2html</code>. The <code>::link</code> annotation
    inserts an "undecorated" link to a local or remote link target. <i>Undecorated</i> means
    the text of the link is the URL or local fragment name of the
    link. "Decorated" links use a different format that's described later.</p>

    <p>Here's another example:</p>

    <pre>::title

    &lt;p&gt;This is the first paragraph in the first sub-section of
    the second section.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a name="_1_1_sub_section_two"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Sub-Section Two&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the first paragraph in the second sub-section of
    the second section.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

    <code><b>02_document_with_sections.html</b></code>

    <h3>A Closer Look at Block Structure</h3>

    <p>Now that we've seen annotations in action, let's look at the structure of
    a block. As you remember from the section above
    (<a href="#_0_The_Very_Basics">The Very Basics</a>),
    blocks are sequences of characters separated by two EOLs (End of Lines.)
    Metadata annotations are semantically attached to blocks. Blocks usually
    have text, but it's possible to make a block with <i>only</i> metadata
    annotations.</p>

    <p>Blocks may also have <i>comment lines</i>. Comments lines only appear at
    the beginning of a block and are denoted by placing two semi-colons at the
    beginning of the line. If you need to include two semicolons at the
    beginning of a line; that is, you <b>don't</b> want the dual semi-colon
    digraph to be interpreted as a comment, you can use a backslash "escape" as
    described in the <a href="#_4_Escaping_and_Preformatted_Blocks">Escaping
    and Preformatted Blocks</a> section below.</p>

    <p>The structure of a block is comments, annotations (metadata) and then
    content. The following example shows an annotated block, an annotation-only
    block and a block with comments:</p>

    <pre>::title An Example Document With Annotated and
Commented Blocks

This is a simple example document.</pre>

    <code><b>02_blocks.html</b></code>
    
    <h3>Design Rationale</h3>

    <p>Many of the documents we wrote contained only two levels; a top level
    with a title and possibly an abstract followed by several sections. We felt
    this is the use case that should be easy for content creators. We also felt
    that metadata <i>should</i> look like an annotation on data that was already
    going to be in the document. So rather than having a separate metadata tag
    for common metadata (think of HTML that has a TITLE element inside it's HEAD
    element) we thought we should just "promote" an existing section with a
    metadata annotation.</p>

    <p>The original version of Lore used different digraphs to identify metadata
    (like title, abstract, etc.) from structural annotations
    (like <code>::section</code> annotations.)  We found it was slightly
    confusing to the users who had to remember what was metadata and what was
    structural annotation. And the tools we wrote handled metadata and
    structural annotation identically during the first phase of parsing. So it
    may seem weird that we use the annotation digraph (::) for both metadata and
    structuring the document, but users said it was easier to not have to
    remember different digraphs and it made no difference to the complexity of
    the code we wrote.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>The <i>Annotation Digraph</i> (<code>::</code>) denotes metadata
      (like title, abstract, author, etc.) as well as structural components in a
      document (like heading level 1, level 2, etc.)</li>

      <li>You can also insert <i>undecorated</i> links using the annotation digraph.</li>

      <li>Blocks consist of comment lines, annotations and content (in that order.)</li>
      
      <li>Comment lines begin with two semicolons (<code>;;</code>).</li>

    </ol>

    <a name="_3_Decorated_Links"/>
    <h2>3. Decorated Links</h2>

    <p>In the section above
    (<a href="#_1_Annotations__Metadata_and_Structural_Directives">Annotations, Metadata
    and Structural Directives</a>), we saw how to specify undecorated links.
    They're called "undecorated" because the link target and the link text are
    the same.  "Decorated" links are links that are decorated with arbitrary
    text.  Decorated links are comprised of a URL and the decoration text
    surrounded by the <i>link digraph</i> or two at-signs (<code>@@</code>):</p>

    <pre>@@ URL text @@</pre>

    <p>Here is a simple example:</p>

    <pre>Here is a simple example of a decorated link.
@@ https://example.org/ Click here to go to !!example.org!! @@.

Links can occur __within other formatting directives.
@@ https://example.com/ Click here to go to example.com @@__.</pre>

    <code><b>03_links.lore</b></code>
    
    <p>Which would be rendered as:</p>

    &lt;a href="https://example.org/"&gt;Click here to go to
    &lt;b&gt;example.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Links can occur &lt;u&gt;within other formatting directives.
    &lt;a href="https://example.com/"&gt;Click here to go to
    example.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

    <a name="_4_Escaping_and_Preformatted_Blocks"/>
    <h2>4. Escaping and Preformatted Blocks</h2>

    <p>We selected syntactically significant digraphs for both their intuitive
    meaning and their uncommonness in typical english prose. A single slash is
    common, but outside of a programming language, a double slash is not. A
    single colon is common, but a double-colon is not. But what if a writer
    really wanted to include a double slash or a double colon? (or any of the
    other meaningful digraphs?) <b>Lore</b> uses the an escaping scheme similar to
    other systems: it puts a backslash (<code>\</code>) in front of the thing to
    be literally inserted into the text. A literal backslash is denoted by two
    backslashes (<code>\\</code>).</p>

    <p>Consider this example, which shows a table of common Lore digraphs:</p>

    <a name="_4_04_lore_cheat_sheet_lore"/>
    <pre>|| \!! || Bold            ||
|| \// || Italic          ||
|| \__ || Underline       ||
|| \** || Monospace       ||
|| \$$ || Span            ||
|| \:: || Annotation      ||
|| \## || Ordered Lists   ||
|| \++ || Unordered Lists ||
|| \|| || Tables          ||
|| \;; || Leading Comment ||
|| \⎵⎵ || Leading Blank   ||
|| \\  || Backslash       ||</pre>
    <code><b>04_lore_cheat_sheet.lore</b></code>

    <p>The important aspect of this table is the use of the backslash in front
    of each of the digraphs. This tells the formatter not to try to use the
    digraph as a formatting (or annotation) instruction, but simply to insert
    that digraph into the text.</p>

    <p>Related to escaped digraphs are <i>preformatted blocks</i>. Preformatted
    blocks are blocks whose content is not interpreted as formatting
    instructions or annotations and are intended to be rendered exactly as they
    appear. Preformatted blocks are denoted as blocks whose first two characters
    are spaces (<code>⎵⎵</code>). If you need to include two spaces at the
    beginning of a line; that is, you <b>don't</b> want the dual space digraph to
    be interpreted as the start of a preformatted block line, you can use a
    backslash "escape" as shown in the chart above. No formatting or annotation
    is honored in preformatted blocks.</p>

    <p>The Lore syntax itself does not require preformatted blocks be rendered
    in any particular way, but it's a good guess that the <code>lore2html</code> tool
    will render preformatted blocks as <b>&lt;PRE&gt;</b> elements in HTML.</p>

    <p>The Lore source of this document provides several examples of
    preformatted blocks. You can find it at
    <a href="https://github.com/mercerism/lore/blob/master/docs/00_introduction.lore">
    https://github.com/mercerism/lore/blob/master/docs/00_introduction.lore</a>.
    But here is a simple example:</p>

    <h3>Design Rationale</h3>

    <p>Most lightweight markup languages provide a way to escape syntactically
    significant characters and prepending syntax with backslash character is a
    common way to do it. We simply re-implemented a common solution.</p>

    <p>Preformatted blocks are also common in lightweight markup languages, as
    is using leading spaces to denote them in the source text. Some languages
    use four leading spaces; others use one or more. Since everything else is
    a digraph in Lore, we thought it would be weird if we <b>didn't</b> use two
    leading spaces to denote a preformatted block.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>

    <ol>
      
      <li>The backslash (<code>\</code>) is the escape character.</li>
      <li>Put a backslash in front of any semantically important digraph (//, !!, __, etc.) and it will demote the digraph to "plain ol' text."</li>
      <li>Preformatted blocks are signified by a block where each line has two leading spaces (⎵⎵).</li>
      <li>No formatting is honored in preformatted blocks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. Including Images, Audio or Video</h2>

    <p>Rich media is an important part of modern communication. While <b>Lore</b> was
    not intended to be a rich multi-media authoring system, it does support
    basic multi-media content. Lore assumes images, videos and audio clips will
    exist as separate files and will be included into the document by reference.</p>

    <p>Images are referenced using an <i>Image Annotation</i> with the following format:</p>

    <pre>::image:height:width:URL</pre>

    <p>The height and width fields are optional, but the enclosing colons must
    be maintained. Here are examples of an image references that do not specify
    the height or width:</p>

    <pre>::image:::./images/4624806398_2b76614983.jpg
::image:::https://live.staticflickr.com/4006/4624806398_2b76614983.jpg</pre>

    <p>And here is what happens when you insert a reference to an image:</p>

    <img src="./images/4624806398_2b76614983.jpg"/>

    authors of this document thank Jon for making this image public. More

    <p>Image references can be enclosed in links, spans or lists.</p>

    <p>While Lore tries to separate content from its presentation, this is
    difficult when it comes to enclosed media. Lore does not provide syntax to
    specify captions, float, clearance or styling of images. However, it does
    allow the use of <i>class annotation</i>. Class annotation is described in
    greater detail in the <code>lore2html</code> documentation. For our
    purposes, it is enough to know that a class annotation <b>immediately
    before</b> an image reference will instruct the <code>lore2html</code>
    parser to include a style attribute in the image tag it renders.</p>

    <p>For example, this lore text:</p>

    <pre>::class:thumb ::image:15:20:./images/4624806398_2b76614983.jpg</pre>

    <p>Will cause this to be rendered in HTML:</p>

    <pre>&lt;img class="thumb" height="15" width="20" src="./images/4624806398_2b76614983.jpg"/&gt;</pre>

    <p>Multiple annotations can be applied to an image. This Lore fragment:</p>

    <pre>::caption:'love' by jon obsworth: ::class:floatleft ::image:::./images/4624806398_2b76614983.jpg</pre>

    <p>Will render as this HTML by default:</p>

    <pre>&lt;img class="thumb" height="15" width="20"
  src="./images/4624806398_2b76614983.jpg"
  alt="'love' by jon obsworth"/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;'love' by jon obsworth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</pre>

    <p>See the documentation for <code>lore2html</code> for information about
    including CSS style sheets in HTML generated from Lore.</p>

    <p>Audio files are included in a document in the similar way: using an audio
    annotation. Audio references include only the URL to the audio sample, but
    can be preceeded with caption or class annotations. Here is an example of an
    audio reference with CSS styling and a caption:</p>

    <pre>::caption:Example Audio: ::class:podcast ::audio:https://example.com/lore_podcast.ogg</pre>

    <p>The <i>controls annotation</i> signals the <code>lore2html</code> utility
    to add a <code>controls</code> attribute to the HTML it generates. For example,
    this audio reference:</p>

    <pre>::controls ::class:podcast ::audio:https://example.com/podcast_week_2.ogg</pre>

    <p>Will generate this HTML:</p>

    <pre>&lt;audio class="podcast" controls muted src="https://example.com/podcast_week_2.ogg"&gt;
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
&lt;/audio&gt;</pre>

    <p>The Lore specification itself does not cover common options to the audio
    HTML element. But the <code>lore2html</code> utility allows users to specify
    which options to include in HTML &lt;AUDIO&gt; tags.</p>

    <p>Video references are similar to both audio and image references. Video
    references include a height and width but also honor the controls
    annotation. For example, this video reference:</p>

    <pre>::controls ::video:160:240:https://example.org/video_sample.mp4</pre>

    <p>Will generate this HTML:</p>

    <pre>&lt;video controls height="160" width="240" source="https://example.org/video_sample.mp4"&gt;
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
&lt;/video&gt;</pre>

    <p>And in the same way audio attribute options can be set with the
    <code>lore2html</code> utility, so can video attribute options.</p>

    <h3>Design Rationale</h3>

    <p>Multi-media inclusions were difficult for the Lore designers. Lore is
    focused on text and in many ways we didn't want to think about multi-media
    options. Lore is not a multi-media authoring system, but how useful is a
    communication tool that doesn't at least address images and sounds?</p>

    <p>Lore was not designed to be all things to all people. It started as an
    experiment and grew into something useful. Along the way we discovered we
    really didn't need a lot of syntax and the less syntax you add, the easier
    it is to read the documents.</p>

    <p>We believe we found a decent middle-ground between utility and
    complexity. Much of what designers <i>really</i> want when they style
    multi-media content is not the domain of Lore. Lore is about annotating text
    with just enough syntax to cover the 80% case; everything else is an
    annotation consumed by a specific tool (like <code>lore2html</code>.)
    Multi-media inclusions use annotations (double-colon markup) because it's
    really the job of tools like <code>lore2html</code> or
    <code>lore2docbook</code> to figure out how they are to be rendered.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>

    <ol>

      <li>Image, Audio and Video multi-media inclusions use annotations to
      reference an external media file.</li>

      <li>Media-specific options (like the ::controls or ::class annotations)
      can be used in conjunction with the multi-media annotation to give a
      rendering app (like <code>lore2html</code>) more context about how the
      media is to be rendered.</li>

      <li>Different rendering apps likely have other options for altering how
      media inclusions are rendered.</li>

      <li>Caption annotations should work with Images, Audio clips and Videos.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>6. Styling Arbitrary Text</h2>

    <p>The designers of Lore attempted to separate content from it's
    presentation. That is, we hoped to avoid mandating specific styles
    for any particular text fragment. However, we felt it was
    necessary to allow authors using the Lore syntax to highlight
    arbitrary text with styling metadata. We don't define how "styled"
    text is rendered, but we do describe a mechanism for communicating
    that text should be styled to the renderer.</p>

    <p>Styled text uses the double-dollar digraph (<code>$$</code>) to
    enclose a style description and a text fragment. In the example
    below, we see a paragraph that includes styled text:</p>

    <pre>This is a simple example of unstyled text. Lore provides syntax
for bold, italic, underlined and monospace. But what if we
needed to annotate a text fragment that needed to be $$ invert
printed in inverse colors? $$ How would that work?</pre>
    <code><b>06_styled_text.lore</b></code>

    <p>This fragment would then be rendered as:</p>

    <pre>&lt;p&gt;This is a simple example of unstyled text. Lore provides
syntax for bold, italic, underlined and monospace. But what if
we needed to annotate a text fragment that needed to be
&lt;span class="invert"&gt;printed in inverse colors?&lt;/span&gt; How would
that work?&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    <code><b>06_styled_text.html</b></code>

    <p>The format of styled text is this:</p>

    <pre>$$ style text $$</pre>

    <p>The first space-delimeted symbol in the styled text defines the
    class or classes to be applied to the text. If multiple styles are
    to be applied to the styled text fragment, they are comma separated
    (without spaces.) For example:</p>

    <pre>$$ blue,translucent This is text that is supposed to be translucent and blue $$</pre>

    <p>And would likely render in HTML as:</p>

    <pre>&lt;span class="blue translucent"&gt;This is text that is supposed to be translucent and blue&lt;/span&gt;</pre>

    <h3>Design Rationale</h3>

    <p>Styled text originally used an annotation syntax like this:</p>

    <pre>::style:blue:I am some blue text:</pre>

    <p>But beta testers thought it looked too confusing. There was just
    a little too much cruft around the text that was actually going to
    be rendered. As an alternative, we picked the dollar sign as the
    basis of the digraph because it looks like the 's' in 'styled'. And
    the syntax is similar to that of <a href="#_3_Decorated_Links">Decorated Links</a>. We
    believe the similarity makes it <i>easier</i> to
    understand, not harder.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Styled text is enclosed by the double-dollar-sign <i>styled text digraph</i> (<code>$$</code>).</li>
      <li>The first "word" in a styled text fragment is the name of the style to apply to the remainder of the text.</li>
      <li>The Lore syntax does not describe how styled text is rendered; it only requires that the renderer take note of the style.</li>
      <li>The <code>lore2html</code> utility uses the "style" in the styled text fragment to produce classes in a HTML &lt;SPAN&gt; element.</li>
      <li>If you apply multiple styles, use commas to separate the names of the style, not spaces.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>7. Tables</h2>

    <p>Tables are blocks that start with a double-bar <i>table digraph</i>
    (<code>||</code>). Their use is easy enough: place each element
    you want in a cell between the double-bar digraph. Here's a simple
    example:</p>

    <pre>|| one || eleven ||
|| two || twelve ||
|| three || thirteen ||</pre>

    <p>Like most other aspects of Lore, the syntax gives you few hints
    as to how the content is styled when it's rendered. And like most
    other aspects of Lore, instead of inventing new syntax for
    options, we use annotations. Tables can take ::class and ::caption
    annotations, like this:</p>

    <pre>::caption:!!A Simple Table!!:
::class:dark,thin:
|| A || 65 ||
|| B || 66 ||
|| C || 67 ||</pre>

    <p>A Table header can be added by introducing a ::header
    annotation. Headers are row-specific annotations and can be
    repeated on as many table rows as desired.</p>

    <pre>::caption:!!A Simple Table!!:
::class:dark,thin:
::header:|| Character || ASCII Code ||
|| A || 65 ||
|| B || 66 ||
|| C || 67 ||</pre>

    <p>Here is what happens when you render this table:</p>

    <table class="dark thin">
      <caption><b>A Simple Table</b></caption>
      <tr><th>Character</th><th>ASCII Code</th></tr>
      <tr><td>A</td><td>65</td></tr>
      <tr><td>B</td><td>66</td></tr>
      <tr><td>C</td><td>67</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>It should be noted though, the HTML version of this
    guide was generated with CSS styling to make the table look
    "nice". And the classes <code>dark</code> and <code>thin</code> were
    defined to give the table a dark grey background and to take up no
    more than 50% of the width of the page.</p>

    <p>Here is a rendering of the table used as an example above
    (<a href="#_4_04_lore_cheat_sheet_lore"/>04_lore_cheat_sheet.lore</a>):</p>

    <table>
      <tr><td>!!</td><td>Bold</td></tr>
      <tr><td>//</td><td>Italic</td></tr>
      <tr><td>__</td><td>Underline</td></tr>
      <tr><td>**</td><td>Monospace</td></tr>
      <tr><td>$$</td><td>Span</td></tr>
      <tr><td>::</td><td>Annotation</td></tr>
      <tr><td>##</td><td>Ordered Lists</td></tr>
      <tr><td>++</td><td>Unordered Lists</td></tr>
      <tr><td>||</td><td>Tables</td></tr>
      <tr><td>;;</td><td>Leading Comment</td></tr>
      <tr><td>⎵⎵</td><td>Leading Blank</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\ </td><td>Backslash</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Cell-based annotations can be applied to table cells by
    including annotations immediately after the double-bar digraph
    (<code>||</code>). This can be used to apply classes to individual
    cells or to set the <code>rowspan</code> or <code>colspan</code>
    attributes for a particular cell. For example, this Lore fragment
    uses class and colspan annotations to make the table look like an
    invoice:</p>

    <pre>::caption:Pretending to be an Invoice:
  ::header: ::class:dark: || Count || Unit || Description || Ext ||
  || ::class:right: 2 || ::class:right $7.99 || 8051 Programmer || ::class:right: $15.98 ||
  || ::class:right: 1 || ::class:right $12.99 || Solder || ::class:right: $12.99 ||
  || ::class:right: 1 || ::class:right $39.99 || Soldering Iron || ::class:right: $39.99 ||
  || ::colspan:4: ||
  || ::colspan:3: ::class:right: Subtotal || ::class:right: $68.96 ||
  || ::colspan:3: ::class:right: Tax (8.25%) || ::class:right: $5.69 ||
  || ::colspan:4: ||
  || ::colspan:3: ::class:right: Total || ::class:right: $74.65 ||</pre>

    <code><b>07_invoice.lore</b></code>

    <p>And here's what it looks like when rendered:</p>

    <table>
      <caption>Pretending to be an Invoice</caption>
      <tr class="dark"><th>Count</th><th>Unit</th><th>Description</th><th>Ext</th></tr>
      <tr><td class="right">2</td><td class="right">$7.99</td><td>8051 Programmer</td><td class="right">$15.98</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="right">1</td><td class="right">$12.99</td><td>Solder</td><td class="right">$12.99</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="right">1</td><td class="right">$39.99</td><td>Soldering Iron</td><td class="right">$39.99</td></tr>
      <tr><td colspan="4"></td></tr>
      <tr><td class="right" colspan="3">Subtotal</td><td class="right">$68.96</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="right" colspan="3">Tax (8.25%)</td><td class="right">$5.69</td></tr>
      <tr><td colspan="4"></td></tr>
      <tr><td class="right" colspan="3">Total</td><td class="right">$74.65</td></tr>

    </table>

    <h3>Design Rationale</h3>

    <p>The authors of Lore believe that the table syntax is ugly. But
    it is the least bad alternative. Much of Lore's semantics involve
    combining annotations, and in the case of tables, it gets ugly
    quickly.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Table cells are delimited by double-bar digraphs (<code>||</code>).</li>

      <li>Each text row of cells delimeted by double-bar digraphs represents a table row.</li>

      <li>Captions and class annotations for the table come before the table.</li>

      <li>Class annotations for table rows come at the beginning of a row.</li>

      <li>Class, Colspan and Rowspan annotations for cells come
      immediately after the opening double-bar digraph.</li>

      <li>Tables are problematic because there is tight coupling
      between class annotations and the CSS or XSLT used to style the
      rendered output as HTML or XML.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>8. Lists</h2>

    <p>There are two types of lists: ordered and unordered. Unordered
    lists use bullets to introduce each new list item. Ordered lists
    use an incrementing count to introduce each item.</p>

    <p>Unordered lists are blocks whose every line begins with a
    double-plus digraph (<code>++</code>). Ordered lists are blocks
    whose every line begins with a double-octothorp digraph (<code>##</code>). Here's
    an example:</p>

    <pre>Remember to buy a few things at the store:

++ Eggs
++ Milk
++ USB Flash Drive

The most important things on the to-do list now are:

## Go to the store.
## Get the car washed.
## Complete paperwork.</pre>

    <code><b>08_A_List_Example.lore</b></code>

    <p>And here's what this fragment looks like when rendered:</p>

    <p>Remember to buy a few things at the store:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>USB Flash Drive</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The most important things on the to-do list now are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Go to the store.</li>
      <li>Get the car washed.</li>
      <li>Complete paperwork.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Syling information can be applied to a list by adding an annotation to the beginning:</p>

    <pre>::list-style:georgian,inside:
++ One
++ Two
++ Three</pre>

    <code><b>08_Another_List_Example.lore</b></code>
