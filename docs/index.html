    <p>Hmm... Github Pages used to be a thing where you put HTML files in
    a different branch and pushed it to the GitHub remote. Now it looks like it
    just publishes the /docs directory. But there's all this stuff about Jeckyll
      and templates. I'm not sure I understand what's going on.</p>

    <p>And it doesn't seem to work. The docs say I can push HTML files to /docs
      master and it should publish them. Maybe I have to wait 'til midnight or
      something?</p>

    <p>Anyway... this is a test file.</p>
