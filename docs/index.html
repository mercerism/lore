    <h1>The Lore Project</h1>

    <p>A lightweight markup language designed to support templating
    and literate programming experiments</p>

    <p><b>Lore</b> is a project that was started when the authors
    attempted to add templating and literate programming features to
    MarkDown and Textile. While the authors <i>love</i> both of these
    systems, the syntax and popular implementations were not as
    extensible as we had hoped.</p>

    <p>AsciiDoc and AsciiDoctor were also considered, but their focus on
    being faithful reproductions of the DocBook schema introduced other
    problems. This is not to say AsciiDoc and AsciiDoctor are bad. We love
    them.</p>

    <p>We wanted a simpler system that could do 80% of what MarkDown,
    Textile and AsciiDoctor could do, but with a slightly simpler
    syntax and a clear separation of syntax and processing
    expectations. Our core objective was to produce an expressive
    syntax that was easy to parse.</p>
